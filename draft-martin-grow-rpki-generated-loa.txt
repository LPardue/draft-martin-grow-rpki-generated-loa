         Generating a Letter of Agency to reflect RPKI Validity
              draft-martin-grow-rpki-generated-loa-latest

Abstract

   Letters of Agency (LOA) are commonly used to authorise network
   providers to accept and propagate routing information received from
   others.  The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) can be used to
   perform a similar function, with the advantage that RPKI-signed
   objects can be validated automatically and in a more robust manner
   than manual processing of documents.  However, some network operators
   have established processes that expect and require LOAs to be
   exchanged, despite their limitations.  This document proposes a
   format for constructing an LOA in the case where RPKI validation is
   available, with the goal of enabling a transition to a future where
   LOAs are no longer needed.

1.  Introduction

   Some organisations use IP addresses that have been assigned or
   allocated for their use and that are independent of any particular
   network service provider.  For such address space to be reachable on
   the global Internet, routing information must be proagated from the
   originating autonomous system and must be received by other adjacent
   or further distant autonomous systems in order for traffic directed
   at those addresses to be sent in the right direction.

Internet-Draft  Generating a Letter of Agency to reflect    October 2024


   Originating routes on behalf of customers has long been a common
   function of network operators.  At the time of writing it is also
   common for other types of provider, e.g. those that provide services
   such as content distribution or cloud compute.  Such service
   providers sometimes use the phrase "Bring Your Own IP" (BYOIP) to
   describe the practice of using customer-supplied addresses to make
   services available on behalf of those customers.

   It is best current practice for network operators not to accept
   routing information from adjacent networks indiscriminately, but
   rather to filter routing information to ensure that Internet traffic
   is not routed inappropriately, e.g. as a result of an operational
   accident or a deliberate attempt to interfere.  Network operators are
   expected to accept routing information selectively, filtering and
   allowing only route advertisements that they have reason to believe
   are legitimate.  In the case of routing information that is being
   received directly from a customer network, or is being originated by
   the network provider on the customer's behalf, such legitimacy has
   often been determined by the customer issuing a Letter of Agency, a
   document that provides authorisation for one operator to act on
   behalf of another.  Such letters are commonly exchanged in the form
   of electronic documents exchanged over insecure mechanisms like
   e-mail with no integrity protection or strong authentication.

   The RPKI provides an opportunity to provide equivalent authorisation
   to a Letter of Agency in a form that is independently verifiable and
   cryptographically strong.  However, many network operators have
   established workflows that include a requirement for a Letter of
   Agency {loa} to be received in order to authorise the propagation of
   a route on the Internet.

   This document describes a template for constructing a Letter of
   Agency in the case where RPKI verification of a request to exchange
   routing informationi is possible.  We propose that network operators
   accept such documents, with corresponding crypytographic validation
   of associated signed objects, in place of a conventional LOA.

5.  Security Considerations

   LOAs do not provide strong authorisation because it is not
   straightforward to authenticate their contents.  Anecdotally, LOAs
   are often accepted by unqualified staff without systematic or
   thorough review.  It is not clear that the exchange of LOAs provides
   useful legal protection to any party in the event that a related
   subsequent complaint was made.

   The form of LOA described in this document does not in itself provide
   stronger authorisation; however, the contents do provide a means by
   which the recipient of a LOA can obtain a measure of authentication
   which is cryptographically strong.  The recipient of a LOA of the
   type described in this document who reads and follows the directions
   within is able to obtain more confidence about the authorised use of
   IP addresses described within it than with a conventional LOA.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Appendix A.  Acknowledgments

   These fine and wonderful people helped with this document.

Appendix B.  Letter of Agency

   A Letter of Agency (LOA) is a document used in telecommunications to
   authorise a provider to act on behalf of a customer.  LOAs were
   originally specified for use in the United States and their use is
   specified in the Code of Federal Regulations Title 47 / Chapter 1 /
   Subchapter B / Part 64 / Subpart K, "S 64.1130 Letter of agency form
   and content".

   LOAs were subsequently adopted more informally for use between
   Internet providers in order to document and authorise the use of IP
   addresses administered by a customer to be made reachable by an
   Internet Service Provider.  The acronym LOA is sometimes taken to
   mean "Letter of Authorisation" despite its original meaning.
